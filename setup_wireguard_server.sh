# BASH script for easily setting up WireGuard VPN Server and Clients

#
# I have been using WireGuard as my personal VPN solution for couple of years now.
# Before that I fiddled around with OpenVPN, sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. I didn't actually like it.
# WireGuard is simple and efficient. It just works. Originally I found a really helpful blog post on DigitalOcean,
# titled "How To Set Up WireGuard on Ubuntu 20.04" @ https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-wireguard-on-ubuntu-20-04.
# I followed it step by step to setup my first WireGuard server. But running those same set of commands
# again and again is not really charming! Hence this is an attempt to partially automate setup of new
# WireGuard server on Ubuntu, running on some cloud service provider's shared infra or my little Raspberry Pi.
# I mostly use Ubuntu or Debian as my choice of OS for running servers. But it should not be very hard for one
# to tweak it to support other Linux distributions.
#
# This script doesn't intend to replace DigitalOcean's above linked guide by any means,
# rather it attempts to make it easy when one needs to run those commands again and again.
# A curious soul should definitely go and check the original guide out. DigitalOcean has some of the
# best written guides in Devops domain, so definitely a huge respect for what they are putting out there.
#
# How is one supposed to use it?
#
# - Go to AWS or DigitalOcean to grab a Linux VM.
# - Transfer this little BASH script to that machine.
# - Execute this script `$ sudo bash setup_wireguard_server.sh`.
# - Successful execution should produce another script in the same directory, named `setup_wireguard_client.sh`.
# - Running `sudo wg` should show you the status of running WireGuard server.
# - Go ahead and open default WireGuard server port 51820 in VM provider's firewall configuration page for both IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks.
# - For DNS, HTTP, HTTPS and other protocol traffic, you have to open those ports too.
# - Now that our WireGuard server should be ready to accept traffic, let's setup clients.
# - We can use our generated BASH script `setup_wireguard_client.sh` to setup as many peers as possible.
# - For setting up first peer, execute the script with `PEER_ID` set to 2 i.e. `$ sudo bash setup_wireguard_client.sh 2`.
# - For each next peer, bump `PEER_ID`, like `$ sudo bash setup_wireguard_client.sh 3`.
# - Ideally, for every new peer that you want to add to this WireGuard server, one will increment that number by 1, starting from 2, until it reaches 254.
# - In essence, for this WireGuard server that you just setup, you can connect upto 253 peers.
# - Now go ahead and execute the client setup script, with your desired `PEER_ID`, grab the `peer_.conf` file it just output. `_` is `PEER_ID`.
# - Finally, you can use this peer configuration file in your mobile or desktop WireGuard clients.
#
