BASH script for easy set up of WireGuard VPN Server and Clients

## How to setup a WireGuard server on Linux VM and connect clients to it?

> [!NOTE]
> A blog post on "Host Your Own VPN Server" @ <https://itzmeanjan.in/pages/host-your-own-vpn_server.html>, guides you through using this BASH script.

- Get yourself a $5/month VPS on AWS Lightsail or DigitalOcean.
- SSH into the machine, clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itzmeanjan/setup-wireguard-vpn
```

- Execute BASH script on the machine. It should setup a WireGuard VPN server on your VPS.

```bash
pushd setup-wireguard-vpn
sudo ./setup_wireguard_server.sh
```

- Check the status of WireGuard VPN server running with following command.

```bash
sudo wg
```

- Go to network configuration page of VPS console and open port `51820`. The WireGuard VPN server is expecting peer connection on that port.
- Executing WireGuard server setup script should generate another script `setup_wireguard_client.sh`. Let's execute that for setting up our first WireGuard client, with `PEER_ID=2`.

```bash
sudo ./setup_wireguard_client.sh 2
```

- It should produce a WireGuard peer configuration file `peer2.conf`. You can import this configuration file in your WireGuard client application to connect to the VPN server, setting up a secure tunnel.
- For mobile users, the script also displays a QR code in the terminal. You can simply scan this QR code from your WireGuard mobile app to import the configuration instantly.
- To check if tunneling is working, lookup your public IP address @ <https://ipinfo.io/ip>.

```bash
curl -s https://ipinfo.io | jq
```

- Also check if your DNS lookups are leaking @ <https://www.dnsleaktest.com/>. We want all the traffic to flow through WireGuard secure tunnel and exit into public Internet, from our VPN server.
- For setting up another WireGuard peer, SSH back into VPS, running WireGuard server, execute the script `setup_wireguard_client.sh` with `PEER_ID=3`. It should produce another WireGuard peer configuration file `peer3.conf`. You can import this peer configuration file in another WireGuard client app.

```bash
sudo ./setup_wireguard_client.sh 3
```

- Simply put, for every new WireGuard client you setup, you have to increment the `PEER_ID` by 1, to assign correct IP addresses to the peers. If you don't do that, tunneling won't work as expected. The WireGuard server gets `PEER_ID=1` allocated. You can keep incrementing till `PEER_ID=254`. Meaning it should allow you to attach at max 253 clients to the WireGuard server.
- If you restart VPS, running WireGuard server, you have to reload the IPv4+IPv6 packet forwarding configuration, from `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```
